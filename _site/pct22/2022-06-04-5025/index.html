The mile walk to the next alleged water cache was filled with suspense as my parched lips puckered at the rising sun. Finally spotting gallons of water beside the trail is the most relief I've felt to see water, possibly ever.</p><p>Shanee is back for a visit bringing welcomed fresh energy. She hiked a few miles up trail to meet me and we spent the rest of the day together enjoying the less than mundane task of stuffing calories and resupplying. I'll stay the night at Hiker Town, a weird wild west themed desert property. Like many elements of this trip I'm uncertain of what's really going on here but I'll pay my 3 dollars for tamales and roll with it.</p><p>In the morning I begin the long walk along the aqueduct toward Tahachapi. I hope to get there by Monday for a much desired zero.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-06-03-0650/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-06-05-0539/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
