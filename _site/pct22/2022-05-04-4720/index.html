Today I doubt I won't.</p><p>After a restless night I woke our camp at 5 am to a faulty forecast of rain. It turns out a power line light flashing in the heavy morning fog looks eerily similar to lightning. None-the-less everyone got up pretty quickly. What a laugh.</p><p>The early morning climb to Lake Morena, among the protection of low laying clouds, was easier than anticipated. There we got some food, filled up water, and like a flock of geese continued north.</p><p>As the day warmed my pack got heavier. Or so it seems. And with that my commitment to positive thinking was fairly challenged. By the time we stopped for lunch I was full of aches, blisters, and angst. Laying under the stars at night just before passing into a deep sleep I realized the physical demand was only a trigger to what had really been troubling me. Since the beginning of the day I hadn't found a moment of solitude. Being surrounded by a group of people is phenomenal, especially with so many other first time thru hikers, yet I hadn't yet found my footing on trail and already felt bogged down by the movements of the group. I found myself moving in sync with others, even if though it was off my own rhythm. Having passed through the day as one might a 9-5 (or in this case a 5-7) I committed to make an active effort to really own each days experience. So at night I camped with a smaller group of people, allowing myself to wake later, taking time in the morning to stretch, and do some exercise (again with David), and &quot;fall behind&quot; on trail. Already I've noticed more wildlife, beautiful scenery, and inner calm. These are the lessons I've come here to learn.</p><p>Today I took it slower, only hiking 10 miles and spending time to sit and enjoy the scenery. Most of this entry was written from the side of a stream from which I refilled. Later on in the day I was suprised to see everyone at the cafe in Mount Laguna. Though we've known each other for less than 48 hours it felt like bumping into old friends. After a few hours of eating, chatting, charging up, and showering, they all moved forward while I stay back to camp with some new friends. Finding my own pace was definitely the right move. The ways of the trail are making themselves known early.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-05-03-2123/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-05-05-3209/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
