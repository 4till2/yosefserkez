Yet mentally I found a clear and determined mind that brought me just shy of mile 142, for a 22 mile day.</p><p>The first seven miles went easily, delivering me to Miles Place. Post apocalyptic is the only way to describe the environment there. As a water cache and charge up point most everyone stops at this trail angles property just a few feet off trail. Surrounding the property are old painted cars, rusting appliances, and the appropriate amount of signs and fences.</p><p>After leaving Mikes Place the familiar pains where muted by something new in my left hip. The rest of the day would become a mentally demanding exercise of will to get myself the 15 or so miles further I had anticipated to hike that day, in order to get myself to Idyllwild by Thursday. For this I turned to the stoic philosophy of Epictetus as inspiration. It's been a while since reading philosophy and I particularly enjoyed the chosen selections read by A.A Long in How to Be Free. Stoicism has always resonated as a philosophy well grounded in practicality. Today I got to realize this.</p><p>Tonight I camp alone for the first time this trip. Tomorrow I reach Idyllwild where fresh food, new shoes and hopefully alleviation await.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-05-10-2211/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-05-12-3359/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
