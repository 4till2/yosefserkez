Reaching Kennedy Meadows is the only major milestone I had set for myself. At mile 700 I dropped in enthusiasm. The sense of accomplishment is incredible. From here on out each step is a gift from my self to myself. The challenge is not near complete, only transformed. And the transformation is exciting. The desert was far different than anticipated. Far greener, more diverse, mountainous, and full of excitement. I'm simultaneously humbled and empowered by my experience through the desert.</p><p>Kennedy Meadows with it's congregation of hikers is a massive reunion of trail friends. Each representing a treasured time from the past 700 miles. There's a strong feeling of accomplishment in the air, especially as everyone cheers for each new hiker to cross into view. There's nothing official about Kennedy Meadows that states you've done anything great, yet everyone here knows what you've gone through to make it here, and what that means moving forward.</p><p>Tomorrow I will get back on trail after picking up my packages and handling other chores. The temptation to stick around this space of comfort and good spirits is strong, but I'll use it as momentum to enter this next stage of the trail, rather than a destination in itself.</p><p>A personally unforgettable momentous day.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-06-12-1801/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-06-14-5400/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
