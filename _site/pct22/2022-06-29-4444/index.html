One nice thing about walking across the country is nearly never waiting around. One is almost always doing something with purpose be it walking eating or resting. Simple purpose but purpose nonetheless. That is until a resupply is in need.</p><p>At the pharmacy the young pharmacist took one look at my toe and said I definitely need antibiotics for its infection. Without any other option I visited the hospital to get the necessary prescription. There the doctor took his time to clean things up and encourage healing. Providing valuable insight and education to better equip me to care for the wounds, he believes to be caused by ingrown toenail's, further. Walking in to the er for an infected ingrown toenail felt wrong and a little inconsiderate of the staffs time. Surely there are far more pressing needs to take their attention. Yet not once did was that impression bestowed on me. The nurses and doctor patiently took their time to care for my minor injury with a care that would have Robert Pirsig shout quality.</p><p>Upon recommendation from the nurse I tried checking into the Mammoth Lakes Inn but found it was too expensive. Informing the clerk of this he invited me to use their spa and public space either way. So I soaked a while in the hot tub and spent some minutes in the sauna, dropping him a tip before heading over to the Motel 6 for a less luxurious but cheaper nights sleep.</p><p>Earlier in the day I had seen an advertisement for a Shakespeare performance in the park which after checking into the hotel checked out, nearly two hours late. Just to see something different. After a few brief minutes of culture I walked back up the street to join Sandals, Crocs, Zombie, and Follow Up at the brewery. From there we went across the street to a local pub for some more drinks, pool, and foosball. I finally got to sleep at midnight reminiscent of the times before the sun dictated my sleep schedule. Town days are exhausting too.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-06-28-2126/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-06-30-3749/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
