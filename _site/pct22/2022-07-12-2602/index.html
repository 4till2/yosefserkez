The next section was beautiful and challenging. Unbelievable wildflowers painted the trail in a multitude of colors and scents. From bright purple to deep yellow the ridge line trail is nothing short of a spectacle. Once back in the trees Benji and I took a near 4 hour lunch break in the shade beside a stream. My longest lunch by a long shot. Slowing down leaves far more room for conversation and relaxation but also once accepted, ease of mind. I did the next 6 miles with seemingly little effort despite it being a three thousand foot incline. At the top was a ski lift station seen uniquely without snow. We hiked only a mile further to camp 12 miles from Donner Pass Road where we complete this stretch tomorrow. It's nice to hike with someone so familiar, in an unfamiliar way.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-07-11-1458/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-07-13-1601/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
