That was until I decided to night hike past the wind mills into the hills providing the wind. Hiking was a constant battle to keep from being blown off the hillside, at times even dropping to a knee for stronger support. A firm reminder of natures might. It was the first time I felt serious concern for my safety on this trip, leading me to seek out a flat place to hold up for the night. Ironically this came just hours after confiding in a friend that I have yet to feel genuinely fearful while hiking. The night was long. Thank goodness for earplugs.</p><p>Earlier I happened upon the woman who manag multiple water caches in the area, including the one that saved me yesterday. I informed her about that and she became visibly excited. We took a nice picture together.</p><p>Im looking forward to hiking beyond the long dry windy stretches of desert that I've become all to familiar with. Sooner though I am excited about spending a night in Tehachapi at a hotel.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-06-04-5025/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-06-06-0229/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
