I decided to take a later ride in the afternoon. Spending the morning relaxing eating and journaling I was prepared to get back on trail. Than Crocs came around and offered to make NJ style bagels. An offer to good to refuse. So exchanged my ride to trail for one to the grocery store. It was late evening by the time we had fresh bagels and cream cheese warming our stomachs. All doubts of my last minute decision to double zero were temporarily dulled.</p><p>Having already checked out of the hostel I'll crashed on one of the couches for the night waking early to get a ride with Jeeves back to trail. Now I'm antsy.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-06-20-3506/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-06-22-5024/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
