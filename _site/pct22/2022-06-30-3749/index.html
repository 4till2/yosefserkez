But I wasn't going to let the bed go unused so I stayed there journaling and uploading photos for a while. Getting up to shower and bring back some coffee and breakfast from the shop next door.</p><p>After checkout I began the days chores. First up I got some fishing line and flies from the nearby sport shop. The sales person there introduced me to the ultra compact and lightweight Tenkara rods which if not for their price tag are the ideal solution for my needs. In it's stead I'll opt to just use my hiking pole as a drop in rod.</p><p>From there I went to food shop at Grocery Outlet. Hungry and impatient to probably calculate the proper strategy, I left with far to much heavy food. Packing it all out took a good while. Hauling the bag back onto my back has been a challenge since.</p><p>Finally before catching the three buses back to the trail head I printed out my temporary fishing license at the local business center. Back at trail I reconnected with Bandit and Robbie on their way to town.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-06-29-4444/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-07-01-2751/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
