At about noon an old friend passed but otherwise I spent it listening to &quot;Arabs - A History&quot;. During my siesta I looked at a map and realized I might be able to get to the main road by Friday if I take an alternate route. Realizing this I arranged a new dentist appointment for Friday afternoon in the closer but smaller town of Lake Isabella. With 35 miles miles to go in 24 hours I anticipated going 15 further today and the final 20 in the morning. However after arriving to the water source 7 miles later I realized a miscalculation that would add another 7 miles to the road. Had I not already hiked nearly 20 miles I might have made the 14 more mile push that day but instead I began to look for other options. Remembering the Facebook group of local trail angels I posted to see if anyone was heading down the one dirt road crossing the trail some 9 miles ahead. Luckily someone was so tonight I camp here along side Magma and Flintstone, and British Comm, with the plan of hustling up to the road by 8am tomorrow morning.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-06-08-0959/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-06-10-2025/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
