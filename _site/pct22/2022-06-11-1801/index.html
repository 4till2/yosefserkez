Someone (probably the gentleman I briefly spoke with in the way into the restaurant who had hiked the PCT in 87) just anonymously paid for my breakfast. Right after someone else offered me a ride to nearly where I need to go today. Whats so incredible about the kindness bestowed by others is its apparent source in inspiration (as opposed to pity or other). Seeing the response by others to the impact my journey has had on me is testimony to the power one experience has on another. Even when crossing individual life lines.</p><p>Needing a ride to Inyokern to pick up my shoes from the post office I hitched with Rodeo and Pause from New York. Rodeo is here supporting her husband Pause on his third (and apparent last) attempt through the Sierras. Both fascinating individuals we discussed Pauses professional experiences as a journalist, turned UN Secretary General public relations officer and Rodeos as the founder of the non profit Games For Change. Shortly thereafter I was finished resupply shopping in my new kicks and back on trail at Wlakers Pass. Waiting for the sun to set before daring to hike it was refreshing to be back spending time amongst hikers known and unknown. There I met and had a long theological discussion with a wise elderly gentleman, Thomas who spends his days on and around trail. With much to think about and many new names to remember, I departed up trail for a pleasant solitary hike into the night.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-06-10-2025/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-06-12-1801/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
