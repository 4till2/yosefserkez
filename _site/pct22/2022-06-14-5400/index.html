Many people had warned to expect trouble there yet my experience was just fine. Another reminder to leave room for ones-own impressions.</p><p>The rest of the day was spent packing, charging, and hanging around. Fitting all of my food into a bear canister is a new challenge to maneuver. In the late evening a few of us left Kennedy Meadows to get ourselves back on trail, even if only a mile.</p><p>Journaling is becoming a tougher process as I'm weaned from initial impressions toward a sustained process. I may leave some space for logless days. Besides the nature of this experience is less bound by daylight as it is by oftentimes multi day sections, so it might be worthwhile to log them as such. Or I'll just continue backfilling every few days.
