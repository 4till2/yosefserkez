Each step came natural and without thought. Hiking is just what is done.</p><p>The day began late and slowly filled with leisurely pressure free walking. The kind of hiking I enjoy most. I did laundry in a river and hiked the rest of the day as a drying rack with nearly the entirety of my wardrobe strapped to the outside of my pack. Out here one must get creative.</p><p>My feet did well for the majority of the day until the days final big climb to where I set up camp for the night. The views here are spectacular and camping with some new faces refreshing. Im very much looking forward to the new shoes I've ordered ahead.</p><p>Beginning the PCT I anticipated camping alone most nights with the hope of meeting people along the way. I still have yet to camp a night alone and am curious to try it. Though it's certainly more comfortable to camp with others Id like to test how it is to call alone. Either way I'll try and stick within a few miles of the tramily and link up every few days or so.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-05-09-1205/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-05-11-5752/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
