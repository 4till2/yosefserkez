Three times I found myself off trail. The first just moments after starting the day, requiring a long tough scramble to rejoin. The others had less of a consequence yet were curiously out of character. I think I might just need some good sleep. Later in the day I stopped to rest beside a river and dozed off for a few minutes which helped. Coincidentally I learned 6 miles before my destination for the day that camping is prohibited for the following 10 miles. So rather than hike a 21 mile day I landed an early night.</p><p>It's a low day so this probably holds less crediability but I'm finding less and less inspiration from what should otherwise be awe inspiring. I spend more time thinking about where I'd like to be than being where I am.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-07-01-2751/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-07-03-2838/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
