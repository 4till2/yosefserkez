Even still there was only a couple miles of extreme heat before a social siesta. I didnt wear my knee brace for the first time in a few days and am thankfully without trouble. I'm optimistic that soon the knee pain will be a thing of distant memory. Possibly out of irresponsible excitement I hiked the last 7 miles of the day at my fastest rate, working to keep up with Slay's natural pace. Even with a quick pause to meet Bowser the toad lizard.</p><p>Today marks the completion of one month of hiking! Tomorrow I reach 500 miles. That's significantly more time and miles than I've previously hiked collectively. Jeez.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-06-01-2055/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-06-03-0650/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
