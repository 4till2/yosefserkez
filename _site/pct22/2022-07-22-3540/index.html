This means returning to an early morning schedule. The alarm went off at 4:30 but unable to open my eyes I snoozed it until 5:30. I woke Bougie, Crumbles, and Sunshine, and was hiking by 6:00. The miles were pretty cool and easy with both Sunshine and me making good time. Views of Mt. Shasta were spectacular.</p><p>At 2:00 pm we stopped at the second water source of the day for a longer siesta, having already completed 18 miles. For the others this is typically a full day so I am clearly pushing them a bit beyond their comfort but we don't have much of an option if we want to get to Shasta by Monday in time for Benjis call. While at lunch LSD arrived and joined us for a rest. Leaving the siesta we planned to camp 8 miles down trail near the next water bringing us to a total of 26 miles, the most yet for many. When Crumbles and I arrived she broke into tears after I told her how far we had come. Sharing a hug she exclaimed that she hadn't even thought 20 miles possible and here she was with two badly hurting feet having hiked far past her personal best. On trail we get to learn how much more capable we are than previously known. We empower our minds and body to live beyond our own preconceived limitations. It was a nice moment to share with someone who until yesterday was an utter stranger.</p><p>After dropping our bags LSD and I took the overgrown side trail a half mile to the nearby stream. There I spotted some fresh bear scat moments after hearing what sounded to be a growl. So as I scooped water from beneath the brush LSD stood watch. It's odd how much more wild it feels when just a few feet beyond the trail we call home.</p><p>Back at camp we made dinner and ate in the dark. Everyone is exhausted but with good spirits. Within moments of laying down I'm asleep.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-07-21-0636/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-07-23-0631/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
