Everything outside of my tent was covered in a layer of dew which I did my best to dry before stuffing into my bag for the day. The first few miles hiking were mentally difficult. The mental challenge is certainly prevailing. Even though the physical demand is more or less at it's maximum. It's insane how beautiful the surrounding environment is yet the feelings brought forth by the circumstances of hiking nearly over shadow all but a few glimpses of awe. Then again there's an impression that will surely live on.</p><p>I hiked alone today positioned between bubbles of friends. Im hiking the Sierras at my own pace even though there is a slight timeline I must follow to keep from starving.</p><p>Moments after reaching the summit of Pinchot Pass a magnificent thunderstorm rolled in. There had been a slight drizzle warning of an impending storm but nothing prepared me for the eruption of nearby thunder echoing through the valley I hurriedly descended to. Being above the tree line I felt vulnerable to the lightning now flashing through the sky. At the first available bush I crouched taking shelter from the storm that had begun pelting hail. Over the next 30 minutes the thunder roared louder and the hail grew larger, nearly reaching the size of marbles. Other hikers joined me beneath this simple bush, more for protection from lightning than the hail. Eventually with no clear sign of the downpour letting up, but the thunder reducing in frequency, we all left our shelter for a dash toward the valley below. Not long after blue skys began to work their way back overhead, pushing the storm further behind us. As the sun came to shine again the valley was filled with chirping birds and a welcoming soft yellow glow. Accepting the invitation I found a grassy area nestled between a lake and her stream to camp for the night.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-06-23-5632/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-06-25-4921/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
