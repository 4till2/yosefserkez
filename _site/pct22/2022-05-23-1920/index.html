Indeed for the first 12 miles everything felt great. Since we received an extra day at our Airbnb we took the opportunity to hike without our usual packs and return to civilization from further down trail. Light packs paired with the low grade made for some really easy walking. Then Dunkirk, David, Pots and I missed a turn and found ourselves a mile and a half off down the mountain. It's this unnecessary 3 miles of climbing that returned the pain. Given that we had a ride waiting for us at mile 281, slowing down was not an option.</p><p>Back in town I've purchased insoles to reduce foot pronation, and hopefully any resulting lateral knee movement. To be determined how this new challenge resolves.</p><p>It's been unique to sleep 4 nights in a bed, eating multiple fresh meals, with the chance to shower at will, and laze before the television, while still having conquered some additional miles. Big Bear has certainly added some welcomed diversity to this experience.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-05-22-1343/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-05-24-3243/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
