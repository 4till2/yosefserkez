Dipping in and out of the valley stream the paths of many confused hikers lead others to a similar daze. Sometimes it was only after accidently rejoining the trail that I realized I had left it at all. Anyhow knowing that I wanted to be in Big Bear before 5pm on Friday motivated me through much of the day only to stop for a small siesta to cool down and rest up for the hike late into the evening. Luckily the second half of the day was far easier than the first allowing me to reach 19 miles with relative ease. In fact besides aching feet I felt good enough to continue further and if it hadn't been for suddenly passing by Fabian's camp I probably would have. But instead after pausing there for dinner I decided against moving forward, leaving the last 21 miles for tomorrow. Probably for the better. The day ended well.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-05-18-2807/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-05-20-4904/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
