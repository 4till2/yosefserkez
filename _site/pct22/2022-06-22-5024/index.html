At 10 am I made it back to the trail head. Already before departing we heard word of hikers returning from their attempted departure due to bad weather. Wanting to make the decision for ourselves we got a ride with Jeeves to the trail head talking through the situation throughout the 1 hour drive. The forecast was for rain and snow along the pass for the next two days. Had we already been on trail this would be a circumstance to deal with, as many hikers currently are; however it seems foolish to knowingly head into the storm. I's mostly concerns of comfort and less so of safety. Knowing it very well may be seven days before my next trip to town, and I lack personal experience in such a scenario I am comfortable with following the others decision to wait another day. It wasn't my intention to triple zero but here I am back in Bishop eating lunch at the bowling alley. At least I got a work out, rest more, do some yoga, and have nice conversation, preparing my mind and body for tomorrow's efforts. It will still be wet and likely no less trouble than today but at least I'm more prepared and informed of what to expect. In the evening I caught up with Jerome, Nienke, and some others from my original bubble learning about their experience descending the mountains today. Apparently it's cold and wet. I'll need to better waterproof my bag. To stay another day is inviting stagnation. Besides it's only the idea of leaving known comfort for unkown discomfort that holds me back. Rain on trail is inevitable. Even if I just return to the trail head and stay the night there I'll have forward momentum. Bishop has provided much comfort for me in shelter, food, and community, but it's time to return to trail to take on the challenge's awaiting.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-06-21-1208/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-06-23-5632/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
