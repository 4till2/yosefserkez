After all I just summited the highest point in the contiguous United States. But then zen teaches us that it's not about the summit but about the climb. Im beginning to understand that.</p><p>Despite the below freezing temperature, high wind, and limited oxygen the climb up is less difficult than anticipated. Likely due to the well graded trail, nearly empty pack, and miles of trail already under my belt. Its a nice reminder of the progress made.</p><p>At the top we take obligatory photos, and throw a little dance party, sharing this major milestone in humor. I want to meditate and contemplate the moment but instead let it just be. There will be time for reflection later.</p><p>The way down is later. I'm feeling more inclined to be in solitude but am also hungry and distracted by the knowledge of what lies ahead. Back at base camp I pack up the rest of my things and make the last of my meals. Getting to town tomorrow is less of an option than it is a requirement now. For where water now runs abundant, access to food has become more scarce. With two passes between us and the next town we depart for another 8 miles before days end. It's well into the night by the time we stop. The last few miles are different though. Ahead of the group, listening to an audiobook, I opt for night vision over a headlamp, forcing a heightened sense of intimacy with the trail. Using what little light available and an unexplainable understanding of the nature of the trail I place each step deliberately with careful yet rapid consideration. Despite being caged in cloth and rubber, my feet tread lightly feeling the earth below. Testing the ground before commiting to the step. If a rock or tree root is felt my weight shifts to the other foot. Remembering water flows here I remove the earbuds to listen for signs of a crossing. Its a good thing too for one came around the corner shortly thereafter. Hearing the voices of people behind me I wait for them to catch up. The stream is small and easily hopable but maybe its better to regroup. Together we decide it's best to stop here for the night leaving the rest of the trek for tomorrow. It's been a long and rewarding day. Time for some well deserved rest.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-06-17-0723/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-06-19-5521/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
