Waking to the clouds hanging low in the valley's of the outstretched mountains was the perfect opening scene to a day filled with spectacle. Then reaching mile 100 filled me with vigor. We took the obligatory photos, and David and I did our promised 100 push-ups. The next 100 are only a few days away as I get stronger and more familiar with what it means to be a thru hiker. Already I have learned countless lessons and am filled with ideas of how to improve moving forward.</p><p>We spent a good few hours in the store in Ranchita, waiting out the high day in the comfort of a resupply shop. As the evening later proved eating 4 hot pockets wasn't the smartest decision but hiker hunger is growing.</p><p>The 8 miles we traversed in late afternoon were the most incredible I've ever hiked. Easy trail first twisting through small hills of greenery eventually opening up into seemingly endless stretches of grass plain, spotted with monsterous rocks, and grazing cattle. In the middle of it all is Eagle Rock. A rock some 30 feet tall and a bit wider, accurately depicting a wing stretched eagle. There we took photos, and per the encouragement of Jerome danced the line dance as taught by Scout.</p><p>Walking onward into the sunset nearly brought tears to my eyes. Days, weeks, and months of events somewhat culminated in this place among the expansive fields now glowing from the last of the falling sun. Even in the moment I couldn't find words, and considering it now I still have but a few. I doubt words will come, as I doubt I'll forget the feeling.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-05-08-0545/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-05-10-2211/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
