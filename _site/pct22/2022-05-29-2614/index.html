First from Tiger Blood who was filling in a gap from her 2020 hike. After summiting Mount Baden Powell together she gifted me a bag of food. Then again later down trail a local couple, Chris and Paco, parked in the lot with a table spread with fresh fruit, snacks, drinks, and more. They were super sweet and eager for us hikers to enjoy the much appreciated delicacies.</p><p>I've yet to be in a more aptly named place than today's Windy Gap. Each time the trail traversed the north side of the mountain I battled winds strong enough to blow me off trail. And as is the spirit of the PCT the day was filled with repetitive summits and descents.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-05-28-0436/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-05-30-0124/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
