The elevation itself is quite doable at this point, even enjoyable at times, but these new blisters possibly caused by the worn down shoes also contributing to further Achilles pain, are no fun and frankly getting a bit old. Despite the discomforts it's become so obvious what I must do that hiking forward is a near instinct rather than choice. But if I may complain just a moment more I'd like to mention my displeasure with the return of sweltering heat this time with thick humidity that reminds me of home. I've possibly never sweat more than I did today. Which is why the quick dip in the cold river was absolutely incredible. I thought I'd push further than the 25 I've pitched camp at but with a long lunch and unplanned cell phone service break I called it at the closer of the two springs after a long uphill water carry. Tomorrow I hope to get just outside of Trout Lake where I'll hopefully pick up new shoes.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-08-06-0227/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-08-08-1547/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
