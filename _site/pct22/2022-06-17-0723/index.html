At least for some time. We left camp beside the lake well into the morning allowing for a relaxed and slow wake up. I chose to hike alone at a slower pace. At one point it dawns on me that I am enjoying the hike. Not too heavy of a pack, and cool weather keep it comfortable while my leisurely pace remains effortless. It only took 750 miles. And lasts about 5. I note to myself that I'll need to do some slower backpack trips when this one wraps up. But for now I have a different purpose. I suppose. Anyway the weather is getting colder and the clouds uninviting so it's best if I get a move on.</p><p>Our campsite is beside a grand meadow a few miles shy of Mt. Whitney. There's a good stream nearby and lots of hikers who know it. It's probably the most populated campsite I've stayed at. Word travels fast among hikers and we hear word that a ranger came by to warn people of cold conditions atop Whitney, resulting in two hypothermic cases this morning. We quickly adjust our plans of a sunrise summit to early morning to avoid near zero temperatures. I'm glad about that decision.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-06-16-5104/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-06-18-2118/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
