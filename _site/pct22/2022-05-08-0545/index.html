I agreed that my shoes were too tight, causing blisters. However after a few miles today in these spanking new Altra Lone Peak 6's my right foot began to hurt badly. A few more miles in and I'm limping wishing it were only blisters. I think the switch to zero drop shoes triggered some previous injuries. It definitely had me bummed for a minute when considering what it would mean if this didn't heal quickly. But im hopeful that tomorrow will show improvement and reaching mile 100 will be as celelebratory as expected.</p><p>I listened to my first on trail audiobook, Longitude by Dava Sobel. Its about the history of the scientific quest to accurately determine longitude. Its a creatively written book with lots of interesting facts about a topic I know so little. Now I've got some new random knowledge about the history of clocks and navigation.</p><p>At camp I offered for others to join me in some yoga and meditation, which nearly everyone did. The post hike physical and mental stretch was certainly welcome.</p><p>While getting water earlier in the day (at a pallets of water bottles delivered to these remote parts by another trail angel) I overheard someone say how rare it is for a tramily of 11 to stick together. Well tomorrow Dunkirk, Stripes, Fabian, Rachel, Sunshine, Jerome, Neinke, Psycho, David, Mike, and myself will have made it 100 miles in 7 days, together. Pretty neat.</p><p>Tonight is another night of cowboy camping under the stars, surrounded by cacti, overlooking a wide mountain valley. Surreal beauty is everywhere in these parts.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-05-07-3337/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-05-09-1205/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
