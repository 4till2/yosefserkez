Thats nuts. I don't really understand what that means. I can comprehend 100 or even 300 miles but 1000 not so much even though its past. Well it's a cool idea but without much meaning in itself.

A reminder that goals and milestones should serve to facilitate a desired journey more than a destination. It's easy to forget in the day to day of hiking that Canada is a destination enabling the day to day experience of hiking.
