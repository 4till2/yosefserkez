But the real trouble of the day is to figure out how to resolve the lost tooth filling that came out while flossing last night. Im thinking it's best to fix it in Ridgecrest since it's the last large city before Tahoe. Mid day I arranged an appointment for the upcoming Monday,w which means I should slow down for the next few days. The potential upside to this is hopefully meeting back with the team on Monday. Ill enjoy the low mileage days though I'm not thrilled to.</p><p>Hiking in sandals is good. Only one blister from rocks. If they had mesh they'd seemingly be perfect.</p><p>I camped at Golden Oaks, after waiting hours for my turn to fill up, due to the slow flow. I'm taking an early night to hopefully get a good nights rest.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-06-07-0349/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-06-09-0516/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
