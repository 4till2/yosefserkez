Wow do my feet hurt. This morning upon waking I decided I'd try to reach the arbitrary milestone of hiking 30 miles in one day. Many people attempt this in the desert or flats of Oregon, yet I figured if I can do it here in one of the more technical parts of the trail I am prepared for anything that the trail throws my way. With the onset of my &quot;trail legs&quot; I figured it a good time to test my limits. I genuinely wasn't sure if I'd make it. Only at mile 27 did I commit without a doubt. And it was the longest 3 miles of my life. Its less so about the number thirty and more so about the empowerment of reaching a desired goal. During the thirteen hours it took to hike thirty miles I traversed an awe inspiring world of beauty and felt nearly every emotion while doing so. I hiked through dense woods with massive ancient sequoias, marched across meadows of flowing grass, climbed up and over snow capped mountains, swam in a frigid glacier lake, hopped across countless streams, wadded across rivers, swatted at hundreds of blood thirsty mosquitoes, and stood feet away from feeding deer. Today began with the question, &quot;can I hike 30 miles through the sierras and what would it feel like to try?&quot;. It ends with the answer yes and it hurts good.</p><p>Tomorrow I can reach Mammoth a day ahead of schedule if I hike 26 miles. That too will be tough, possibly even more so after exhausting my body today. To be determined if I do.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-06-26-4049/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-06-28-2126/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
