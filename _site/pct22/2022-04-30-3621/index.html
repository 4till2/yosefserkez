This led to our eating together and my invitation for her and a nearby German girl, Leia, to join our excursions for the day.</p><p>Before we left I noticed someone who appeared to be with all the gear for a big hike. Upon inquiry I learned Neinke is too heading up the PCT this season. So we gave her a ride to Scout and Frodos (PCT hosts), presumably offering her her first bit of trail magic. While there I inquired about staying with them as well, so that I can meet other hikers and ease my way on to trail. At first there was a hestitance due to my lack of booster but we settled on a rapid test upon arrival. So tomorrow evening I camp in their backyard among other hikers departing early Monday morning for the trail.</p><p>From there Alfston, Hiren, Monica, and Lea and I spent a few minutes at the Mall picking up some food and clothes before heading for the La Jolla beach. At the pressure of my friends I got a pair of properly fitting lightweight pants for the trail. Apparently not good enough. Maybe tomorrow I'll try again wherever we go for the last of my goods.</p><p>The cold ocean water always reminds me of something. This time it was how simultaneously frightening yet appealing I find the power in each wave. For the next few hours we bathed in all that is La Jolla Beach. Steep rocks, lead to a beach wide with sand. Clothing optional rules leave many without, and just enough discomfort for the rest of us to notice.</p><p>We got a real kick out of watching a much older gentleman brazenly flirt with an attractive young model, both in the nude, rather successful. We took turns hypothesizing about the escalating circumstance before us. With questions unanswered a brave member of our watch party approached the man (once alone again) to inquire for some explanation. He didn't provide much in terms of wisdom.</p><p>Back at the hostel we cleaned up and reconvened for dinner. With our small crew we spent until closing at a Mexican restaurant in conversation. High in spirits some went back out for the night life and others, myself included, stayed back for a more quite evening.</p></div><div class="my-4 font-thin"><a href="/pct22/2022-04-30-1205/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 mr-4">Previous Post</a> <a href="/pct22/2022-05-01-0240/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Next Post</a></div></div></div></body></html>
