  <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm" aria="About">
        In May 2022 I embarked on a journey across America, by foot. For 4 months I walked 
        through the Sierra Nevada mountain range, 2000+ miles from Mexico to Canada. This walk opened my eyes, and heart to our magical world.
        I have yearned for the same sense of life every day since. In many ways I see the experience as a capstone project to years of prior 
        efforts. Yet it's also the origin story to the life I live now. A life where I pursue a goal no matter it's percieved absurity. Maybe someday I'll 
        find a way to organize the experience and all it's nuanced lessons, but for now I'm content with the many mental impressions, and (almost) daily journal entries seen below.
